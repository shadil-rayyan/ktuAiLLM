# Chat with KTU Notes Using Gemini RAG Model ðŸ’¬

This Streamlit application enables students to interact with their KTU (Kerala Technological University) course materials using conversational AI powered by Gemini. The application uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to provide accurate and context-aware answers based on uploaded documents like textbooks, notebooks, and PDFs.

## Features

- **Upload Course Materials**: Users can upload KTU course materials, including textbooks, lecture notes, PDFs, etc.
- **Process PDFs and Notes**: The app extracts text from the uploaded documents and organizes them into chunks for indexing.
- **Search and Chat**: Students can ask questions based on their course materials, and the app responds with accurate answers using a combination of FAISS vector search and generative AI powered by the Gemini API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries specified in `requirements.txt`
- Google API Key configured via environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google API Key:

    ```makefile
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application**:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Interact with the application**:

    - Upload your KTU course materials (textbooks, notes, etc.) via the sidebar.
    - Click "Submit & Process" to extract text from PDFs, notes, or textbooks and create vector embeddings.
    - Enter a question related to the uploaded material in the input field.
    - Click "Ask" to receive an answer generated by the Gemini RAG model, tailored specifically to the uploaded course content.

## About

This project demonstrates the integration of PDF processing, semantic search using FAISS, and conversational AI with Google's generative models through the Gemini API. By leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, the application selects the most relevant content (textbooks, notes, etc.) to answer student queries with high accuracy.

The goal is to provide an accurate, intuitive, and personalized experience for KTU students by answering their questions based on their specific course materials. Whether it's textbooks, lecture notes, or notebooks, the RAG model enhances the accuracy and relevance of the answers.

## Credits

- **Streamlit**: Frontend framework for building interactive web applications.
- **Google Gemini API**: Provides the generative AI model for answering questions.
- **FAISS**: A library used for efficient similarity search and indexing of documents.
- **KTU (Kerala Technological University)**: The university for which this application has been developed, specifically aimed at helping students interact with their academic materials.
